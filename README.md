# e-commerce back end using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Description

For this challenge I was tasked with building the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

The following steps are needed install and interact with the project: 
1. Clone the repo: https://github.com/vpratnicki/e-commerce-back-end.git
2. Install the following packages: 
- [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database 
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like MySQL username, password, and database name.

## Usage

Once the required packages are installed (see section above) follow these steps to interact with this app:
- Create an .env file and enter the database name, user and password. 
- Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands.
- Run 'npm run seed' to seed data to your database (in the package.json file, make sure "seed": "node seeds/index.js" is listed under scripts)
- Run 'npm start' and test the API endpoints. View the videos below for a walkthroughs.
